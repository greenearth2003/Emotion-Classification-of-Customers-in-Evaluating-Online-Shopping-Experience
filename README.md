## Project Information
### 1. Introduction
Text emotion classification is a typical problem in the field of Natural Language Processing. Along with the continuous development of various approaches, solving this problem has become more efficient and has achieved high accuracy.

In this final project, we carry out the project Classify emotion of Customers in Evaluating Online Shopping Experience.

### 2. Dataset 
We used the available dataset from Kaggle: [Vietnamese Sentiment Analyst](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linhlpv/vietnamese-sentiment-analyst)

### 3. Model
We used a pre-trained [PhoBERT](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoBERT) model to extract features from the text and apply basic Machine Learning models such as Support Vector Classification (SVC) for training and classification.
