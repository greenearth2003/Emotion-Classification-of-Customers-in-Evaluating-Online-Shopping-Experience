## Project Information
### 1. Introduction
`\t` Text emotion classification is a typical problem in the field of Natural Language Processing. Along with the continuous development of various approaches, solving this problem has become more efficient and has achieved high accuracy.

`\t` In this final project, we carry out the project Classify emotion of Customers in Evaluating Online Shopping Experience.

### 2. Dataset 
`\t` We use the available dataset from Kaggle: [Vietnamese Sentiment Analyst](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/linhlpv/vietnamese-sentiment-analyst)

### 3. Model
`\t` We use a pre-trained [PhoBERT](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoBERT) model to extract features from the text and apply basic Machine Learning models such as Support Vector Classification (SVC) for training and classification.
